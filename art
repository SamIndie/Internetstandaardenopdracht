        <p class="part">NIVAWO’s Words & Art is an art business developed by a true autodidact who learns by observing and doing. As a child, I remember very vividly, being curious and explorative towards anything new. That was my main attitude. I was a dreamer, deep thinker - a kid who wanted to try out anything, supported and validated by my care givers and protectors. I was keen on doing things myself, but very eager to learn from others how to do those things, so that I could perform any task or activity on my own.</p>

        <p class="part">As most of us grew up, we are unconsciously and unintentionally conditioned by the emotional projections of the people who raise and protect us. As kids we are prone to protection and therefor, in most cases, unintentionally held from living our true nature: playful, adventurous, explorative truth seekers. As was I, imposed by fear, doubt and anxiety towards the unknown and most of all fear of failure. I unconsciously thought myself that only those who have natural talents for creative expression, were able to make effortless art, paintings, designs, drawings and more. I thought there were creatives and math kids.</p>
        <li><img src="img/IMG_1473.jpg" alt="wordart1"></li>
        <p class="part">Some of these thoughts were also formed by the unconscious patterns I was seeing around me: book smart kids (and adults) were more appreciated, applauded and validated. It seemed like they received more praise and love. Dreamers, drawers and crafters were shunned and undervalued. So back then, seeing the life my father lived as a painter, a real craftsman and how people treated him, I never even tried being one of those. I taught myself that trying anything new, expressive or creative was a definite setup for disaster. So I went for the validation and the praise.</p>

        <p class="part">Many years later, after becoming very aware to this societal pattern and digging deep into my true autodidact nature - breaking free from any unnatural imposed behaviour, I am developing NIVAWO’s Words & Art. This art concept business is the most truest thing to my heart I have ever developed. Its a concept translating many forms of communication into concepts to be indulged, understood and motivating to many people. My main purpose with this concept is to express my art and help raise people’s consciousness on many topics surrounding them. From knowing thyself and others, to the (emotional) intelligence of your inner compass, but also connecting with the changing world around you. Whatever you feel you get from the expressions, that message is meant for you.</p>

        <p>The words and other forms of expression you see in any of my concepts are all intentional, flowing from my being in its most truest and deepest form. I believe that sharing my craft with the world is my Dharma - Sanskrit for life purpose. The craft is not about me, not about the validation or praise it attracts or that I feel it deserves, but merely the truest form of expression that I put into the world to serve its increasing consciousness. If I catch myself in patterns of making this about myself, rest assure that I will be checking myself in the other room.</p>

        <p>If there is anything on this platform that speaks to your heart, check in with your inner world and reach out with a full YES. If you are hesitant, have questions or need a bit more of an explanation, I will be at the other end making sure to get back at you</p>
